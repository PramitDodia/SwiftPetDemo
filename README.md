CatApp - Random Cats with MVVM

This project demonstrates the use of the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture and asynchronous programming with async/await.

The application follows the MVVM Architecture:
Model: Represents the data structure (e.g. Cat).
ViewModel: Handles business logic and acts as the intermediary between the View and the Service layer.
View: The UI layer, built using SwiftUI, observes the ViewModel for updates.
